# Hotel_Revenue_Analysis
I created a database in SQL Server Management Studio using the hotel data from Excel. I then wrote SQL queries to analyze revenue growth, trends by hotel type, and parking patterns. Finally, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to display the results.

## Dataset used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Ilaha-Habibova/Hotel_Revenue_Analysis/blob/main/hotel_revenue.xlsx">Dataset</a>

I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data and tried answer the following questions:
1) Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
2) Should we increase our parking lot size?
3) What trends can we see in the data?

## Insights:
- It can be seen that the revenue rose from 2018 to 2019 but declined again in 2020.
- We can see that there is sufficient parking space, so expanding the parking lot is unnecessary.
- City Hotels contribute approximately 48.32% of the total revenue, while Resort Hotels contribute about 51.68%. This suggests that Resort Hotels are slightly more profitable or have higher revenue generation compared to City Hotels.
- The average daily rate (ADR) rose between 2019 and 2020.
- There was a decline in the total number of nights booked by customers from 2019 to 2020.
- The hotel increased its discount percentage from 2019 to 2020 to draw in more customers.
