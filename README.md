# Hotel_Revenue_Analysis
I created a database in SQL Server Management Studio using the hotel data from Excel. I then wrote SQL queries to analyze revenue growth, trends by hotel type, and parking patterns. Finally, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to display the results.

## Dataset used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Ilaha-Habibova/Hotel_Revenue_Analysis/blob/main/hotel_revenue.xlsx">Dataset</a>

I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data and tried answer the following questions:
1) Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
2) Should we increase our parking lot size?
3) What trends can we see in the data?

- It can be seen that the revenue rose from 2018 to 2019 but declined again in 2020.
